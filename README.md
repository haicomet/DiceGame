Test Case1:
1. create a Dice object using default constructor
2. create a Dice object with positive number of sides
3. check the topSide after rolling the dice, ensure it is within [1, sides]

Game:

Create two dice objects, roll the both dices and compare which one is bigger [X]
Repeat the tasks above 5 times and compare which dice wins more [X]
Implement a method to check if an array tracking the top side after rolling N = 5 times contains a given number. [X]
Implement a method to create an array of unique numbers by rolling a dice (roll as many time as needed) [X]
