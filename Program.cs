/*Ludi : you can play with 2 to 4 players. a player needs to roll two 6s to get a piece out of the base.
 once a piece is out of the base, the player can move it forward by the number rolled on the dice.
 if a player rolls a 6, they get another turn. if a player lands on a space occupied by another player's piece, 
 the other player's piece is sent back to their base. the first player to get all their pieces to the finish line wins the game.
